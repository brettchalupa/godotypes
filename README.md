# Godotypes

Godot prototypes & experiments dedicated to the public domain.

Made with Godot 4.0.

**Note**: none of the prototypes are intended to be polished, and the code may not be particularly good.

[ðŸŽ® Play the prototypes on itch.io!](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/godotypes)

## Developing

0. Install Godot 4.0
1. Clone the repository
2. Open up `project.gdot`

## Debug Shortcuts

- <kbd>0</kbd> â€” toggle debug UI

## Build Exports

The `export` script uses Ruby for now (sorry). Run it with:

``` console
./export
```

`godot` must be present in your environment as an executable for the script to work.

If you configure `[itch]` in `export.cfg` with `user` (your handle) and `game` (your game slug) and have [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/) installed, your builds will automatically get pushed to itch.io.
