Template repository for getting started with a new Godot game quickly. Godot Skeleton handles the boring stuff like main menu, pause menu, settings that persist and load from disk, and structuring your project.

Godot versions supported: 4.0+

## Bugs/Features

- Main Menu, Settings, Gameplay, and Pause scenes
- Mouse, keyboard, and controller support by default
- Sensible defaults
- Convention over configuration
- Easy to change
- Ship quickly, ship often
- Developed with all platforms in mind
- Minimal yet stylish
- Each scene has its own folder
- Preconfigured exports for Web, Linux, macOS, and Windows
- OS-aware menu options & settings
- Build script for exports (requires Ruby and untested on Windows)
- Automatically upload to itch.io if [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/) is installed

## Use It

- Go to https://github.com/brettchalupa/godot_skeleton and click "Use this template"
- Or [download the source](https://github.com/brettchalupa/godot_skeleton/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it, and you're good to go!

## Set Your Game Up

1. Add a title to your game and change the credits
2. Configure exports
    - Change the bundle identifier for the MacOS export
    - Add or modify based on your game's needs
3. Set up the `[itch]` section in `export.cfg` for your game on itch.io

## Notes

- Don't worry about keeping your game up to date with Godot Skeleton. It's intended to just be a starting point. When you use it again, it may have some improvements!
- Gameplay defaults to a 2D scene, but you can easily change that for your game's needs.
- Keyboard controls:
    - Config I:
        - Directional input: WASD
        - Confirm: J
        - Cancel: K
        - Pause: P
    - Config II:
        - Directional input: Arrows
        - Confirm: Z
        - Cancel: X
        - Pause: Esc
- Joypad controls: Xbox config where bottom button is confirm
- Settings config gets written to the userspace, [see the docs for details on the per-OS location](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#accessing-persistent-user-data-user)

_More to come as I make more games with Godot!_

# Your Game

[describe your game]

## Developing

0. Install Godot 4
1. Clone the repository
2. Open up `project.gdot`

## Build Exports

The `export` script uses Ruby for now (sorry). Run it with:

``` console
./export
```

`godot` must be present in your environment as an executable for the script to work.

If you configure `[itch]` in `export.cfg` with `user` (your handle) and `game` (your game slug) and have [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/) installed, your builds will automatically get pushed to itch.io.
