We find ourselves witnessing a rare meeting...
Red: Hi, there!!
Red: What, you don't know me?
Blue: ...
Red: We met last week!
Blue: Oh yeah, I remember you!
Red: Oh, this is what we call a long line mate! Let's hope it wraps or something similar.
Blue: You think you're so special with your long line?! Well here's an even longer line! Yeah, that's right. It breaks outside of the boundaries of space and time.
